    NPCS only need 2 or more traits to be good, so throwing questions to the user is a great way to get a good idea of what he is looking for,
    is he looking to make the bbeg of his campaign or just a random farmer boy that the heros need to talk to find the next encounter or adventure location,
    
    asking and being quick will be the focus of this generator.
